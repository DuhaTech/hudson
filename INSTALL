Windows
=======
Hudson was developed on Windows 2000 using VS7 and MacOS 10.4 (Tiger) with g++ 4.0.1.
If you are compiling under Windows, simply open one of the solution files under the
'app' sub-directories. Change the Additional include directory and Additional library
directory options to point to your TA-LIB, GSL and Boost installations.
The solution is setup to automatically compile the library files under 'lib' and
link the application.

Linux/MacOS
===========
You should have the following files in your root directory: 

COPYING  INSTALL  TODO     db       lib
Doxyfile README   app      doc      results

cd to the 'lib' directory and make sure the -I and -L are point to valid directories
in your system where the TA-LIB, GSL and Boost installations are. Run 'make' to 
compile the Hudson library, then move to each 'app' sub-directory to compile the
example programs:

# cd lib
# make

# cd ../app/JanTrader
# make

That's it. Do this for each directory under 'app', then run the examples using the
options specified in each example directory README file.
