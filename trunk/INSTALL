The hudson library and the sample applications can be compiled using cmake. The CMakeLists.txt in the root directory is designed to first compile the source code under lib, then each app program.

1. Edit CMakeLists.txt and adjust the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and LINK_DIRECTORIES to point to your system location where ta-lib, gsl and boost can be found.
2. Edit lib/CMakeLists.txt and change INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES as per previous instructions.
3. Choose a build directory. I usually create one directory containing the debug version of the binaries and another one for optimized binaries.
4. cd to the build directory, run cmake, then make:

# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake .. 
# make
